### Homework 6: MVC & Existing Database
For this assignment, we were asked to create an interactive MVC search engine application where the search result come from an existing database.


### Getting Started
For this assignment, we were asked to use only Viusal Studio Community 2017 IDE. I downloaded the IDE by going to [Visual Studio IDE](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) . After I installed Visual Studio, I created my program by choosing the "Web -> ASP.NET Web Application(.NET FrameWork)" option and then I choose the MVC option.
The second tool that we need is to install Linqpad, which is very helpful for testing out the lamba commands and the existing database
